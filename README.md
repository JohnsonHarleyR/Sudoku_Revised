# Sudoku_Revised
Not yet complete, but this new revised version has a steady layout so it won't mix up the numbers on the board.

This starts by generating a random Sudoku board.

To do:
-Edit algorithm so the board is generated more quickly.
-Create different levels
-Only allow some of the cells to appear
-Buttons to change number
-Basically make it a playable game
